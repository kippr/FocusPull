- check todos
- show aged tasks and projects in metamap
- make 'weight' relative to total tree
- what do deleted tasks show up like?
- make focusParser.parse a class method rather than instance
- add child takes block, so it can call stack pop automatically?
- 'histogram' output for:
  - open project age
  - open task age
  - done project life
  - done task life
? consider splitting mindmap_factory file up?
? consider 'aged tasks' node for metamap?
