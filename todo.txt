- check todos
- move aged items under an 'Aged' node, which will help with failing test?
- make 'weight' relative to total tree
- weight for (esp done) delta tree should include completed items!
- what do deleted tasks show up like?
- make focusParser.parse a class method rather than instance
- add child takes block, so it can call stack pop automatically?
- 'histogram' output for:
  - open project age
  - open task age
  - done project life
  - done task life
  - on hold projects?
  - dropped projects?
? consider splitting mindmap_factory file up?
? consider 'aged tasks' node for metamap?
? is there a way I can filter for 'recently put on hold' items? Dont think so unless I assume using modified_date?


- move filestorage onto amazon s3
