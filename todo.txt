X resolve refs to other nodes
X add project status
X add start, modified and completed times as attributes
X add task status (e.g. completion date)
X add tasks
X load folders
X change from map of names to tree structure (with parent == null attaching to root)
X create cut-down xml for test
X create spec for map factory
X order children by rank
- clean up to_s
- check todos
X implement visitor pattern for map formatting?
X use Nokogiri slop for tests?
- new map type: delta from last week? recently completed?
X folder & project methods filter by type
X tree traversal with callback
X colour tasks differently
- colour dropped tasks differently?
X colour folders w/o children as #bfd8e5, with <edge COLOR="#cccccc" STYLE="bezier" WIDTH="thin"/>
X use 'childless' colouring for folders that have only folders as kids
- there is a link b/w mindmap output nodes and focus nodes, so we can post-traverse
- add 'filter text' to Portfolio node, maybe even replace TEXT with this:
<richcontent TYPE="NODE"><html>
  <body>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      Portfolio
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      <font size="2">2010-12-08 - 2010-12-13</font>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
</richcontent>
X done projects (and tasks?) should have this added: <icon BUILTIN="button_ok"/> (before attributes)
X inactive projects should have this added: <icon BUILTIN="stop-sign"/> (after font)
- simple map shouldn't show 'done' tasks?
? cleanup tree traversal
? cleanup pos decision
? visitor with extra args
? make visit dispatch dynamic
