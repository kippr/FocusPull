- check todos
- 'histogram' output for:
  - open project age
  - open task age
  - done project life
  - done task life
  - on hold projects?
  - dropped projects?
? consider splitting mindmap_factory file up?
? is there a way I can filter for 'recently put on hold' items? Dont think so unless I assume using modified_date?
- consider losing aged projects node? stalled more useful?

- refactor to a model of some kind, make my requests more RESTful
- check if focus is in session, send to login page?

- refactor filtering to be a generic focus delegate (wrapper on traverse, search methods)
