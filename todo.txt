- check todos
- move aged items under an 'Aged' node, which will help with failing test?
- make 'weight' relative to total tree
- weight for (esp done) delta tree should include completed items!
- what do deleted tasks show up like?
- make focusParser.parse a class method rather than instance
- add child takes block, so it can call stack pop automatically?
- 'histogram' output for:
  - open project age
  - open task age
  - done project life
  - done task life
  - on hold projects?
  - dropped projects?
? consider splitting mindmap_factory file up?
? consider 'aged tasks' node for metamap?
? is there a way I can filter for 'recently put on hold' items? Dont think so unless I assume using modified_date?

- item.completed should take dates, not strings?
- sorting by rank is broken!! add/ fix test for this, and reimpl in parser
- chained filter methods on @focus? e.g. @focus.all.active.single_actions

- refactor to a model of some kind, make my requests more RESTful
- refactor create to something else
- check if focus is in session, send to login page?
- in completed map, personal things are showing up, tho parent folder isnt

- refactor filtering to be a generic focus delegate (wrapper on traverse, search methods)
