- there is a link b/w mindmap output nodes and focus nodes, so we can post-traverse
- add 'filter text' to Portfolio node, maybe even replace TEXT with this:
<richcontent TYPE="NODE"><html>
  <body>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      Portfolio
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      <font size="2">2010-12-08 - 2010-12-13</font>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
</richcontent>
